## Arrhythmia Classification by Using Convolutional Neural Network with  2-D ECG Spectral Image Representation

This project is full implementation of this [article](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/10/1685) by me.\
The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mondejar/mitbih-database).\
The one-dimensional ECG time series signals are transformed into 2-D spectrograms through short-time Fourier transform and Recurrence Plot.
